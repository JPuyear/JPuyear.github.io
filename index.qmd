Hi, I'm Josh! I'm a greenhouse technician at Summit Plant Labs and an educator at the Environmental Learning Center in Fort Collins. I'm interested in incorporating native seed conservation to help communities build a sense of place. I want to explore native seed supply and growout infrastructure development to maximize ecological restoration opportunities. In my free time, I enjoy biking, hiking, and playing my songs.

<h3>Education</h3>

<h6>Colorado State University | Fort Collins, Co</h6>
<h6>Bachelor of Science in Restoration Ecology | Aug. 2021 - May 2025<h6>
